## What is Flaskr?

A sqlite powered thumble blog application based on [Flask](http://flask.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

## Installation

Clone the repo first

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:christian-bromann/flask-webdriver-demo.git
$ cd flask-webdriver-demo
```

Virtualenv is probably what you want to use during development, and if
you have shell access to your production machines, youâ€™ll probably want
to use it there, too.

```sh
$ sudo easy_install virtualenv
```

or

```sh
sudo pip install virtualenv
```

Now, whenever you want to work on a project, you only have to activate
the corresponding environment. On OS X and Linux, do the following:

```sh
. venv/bin/activate
```

Then install all requirements:

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run app

If you start the application for the first time, you need to initialise
the database first:

```sh
$ python init_db.py
```

Run the app by using the Flask CLI

```sh
$ flask --app=flaskr run
```

## Run tests

Replace the existing Sauce Labs credentials in the `.travis.yml` with
yours by executing

```sh
$ travis encrypt SAUCE_USERNAME=YOUR_USERNAME --add
$ travis encrypt SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY --add
```

Make sure that your Sauce credentials are available as environment
variables in your terminal, run the following command:

```sh
echo "export SAUCE_USERNAME=YOUR_USERNAME
export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY" >> ~/.bash_profile &&
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Download and run [Sauce Connect](https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/sauce-connect/).
After that start the test by executing:

```sh
$ ./test.sh
```
